## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Before using the VM, ensure that the following software is installed:
- **CMake** (for building the project)
- **Docker** (optional, for containerization)
- **Python** (for AI/ML models, if needed)

### Build the VM
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/vm_project.git
   cd vm_project
